The easiest way to get started with bpptkg-meteo is viewing the source code.
bpptkg-meteo provides several modules that help you store and process
meteorology data. You can also view simple application in ``examples``
directory.

Currently we use vaisala app from ``examples/vaisala/`` directory to store and
process meteorology data from ``192.168.9.47`` Pasarbubar weather station. See
``examples/vaisala/README.md`` for more details.
